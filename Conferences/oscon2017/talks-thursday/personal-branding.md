Personal branding is more than self-promotion
---------------------------------------------

Branding can be very powerful:
- jobs
- opportunities
- recognizability
- expansion of network
- proactively shows people what you'd like to talk about
- can get you to your next steps
- can provide a safety net around your plan B

> These days when you're talking to one person, you're talking to a 1000.

Branding is the intentional strategy behind going to the "you now" to the "you" you want to be.

What is going to make your "tree" unique?

> Define > Curate > Grow > Learn.

Branding is about OTHERS think and say about you.

##### DEFINE: What do people know you for?
- What are your values?
- What do people think are your top qualities.

> Ask people what your top qualities are (don't actually do it atm).

Learn about your personal brand by iterating between feedback and actions.

##### WRITE 3 qualities about your future you:
1. Go-to Mentor for people trying to solve certain problems.
2. Creator of educational content for difficult problems (like Machine Learning Problems)
3. Creator of applications .

##### GROW: How are you going to get there?
Bridge the gap between current "you" and future "you". What's missing?
Take 3 things you want to be known for and find 3 things to do for each.
What does success look like for each step?
1. Have people contact me when trying to find people to solve certain problems (recruiters, colleagues, followers, etc).
2. Have an article site up with articles containing easy to follow tutorials.
3. Have some web applications up and visible to the world through my domain.

##### LEARN: Learn from your successes or accomplishments.
Promote your brand. Check out tools like [Storify](https://storify.com) and [Buffer](https://buffer.com).
Don't be worried about overpromoting, people care more about themselves than they do about you.

> REMEMBER: You are remembered for how you affect others' lives.
