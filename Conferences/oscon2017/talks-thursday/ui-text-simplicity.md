--------------------------------

Here is the [link](http://slides.com/mike-1/osconjang) to slides.

10 steps to better UI text 
##### 1. Know your product
- DON'T have a complete, accurate depiction of functionality.

##### 2.  Don't make me think!
- Although sometimes, you SHOULD make users think.

##### 3. One Easy breath.

##### 4. Limit to 2 thoughts.

##### 5. Minimize (or eliminate) the need for docs.
Bad UIs -> Ugh, let me read the docs.

##### 6. Know your audience.

##### 7. Know your stakeholders

##### 8. Start with the easy stuff.
- functional text
- capitalization
- grammar
Remove redundancies

*Be flexible*   
- minimal viable text
- incomplete sentences ok
- no periods ok
- incorrect grammar ok
- don't apologize

##### 9. Harder stuff, do your homework

##### 10. Scaling: use style guides
Consider your: 1. audience, 2. precedents
Consider accessibility.

Make every single word earn its place!!
- Buttons: be suspicious of 2 word buttons "Save changes" -> "Save"

Messages:
- Don't blame the users, be helpful!
