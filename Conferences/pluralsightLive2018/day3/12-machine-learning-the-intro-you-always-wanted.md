# Machine Learning - The Intro you've always wanted

Programming *without* machine learning: (oversimplifying) strict if/else conditionals.

Machine Learning is a new way to solve problems.

- How should we price our new product
- How often should we send marketing emails?
- Will this customer renew?
- Is the conversation good or bad?
- Is our website about to get attacked?

We need to build our ability to recognize these situations.

Embrace Machine Learning Cliches:

- Is this email spam/not spam?
- Is this purchase fraudulent?
- What product to recommend?
- Is there a flower in that photo?

Q: What ***is*** the difference between AI and Machine Learning?

A: Machine Learning ***is*** a subset of artificial intelligence.

---

Classification:

- incoming email - spam/not spam?
- website activity - high value customer or not?
- incoming attachment - classify as contract or not a contract?

Machine Learning: working definition

- Take **Existing Data**
- **Analyze** it to **identify patterns**
- Then use the **results**
- to **make better predictions** about **new data**

---

#### 1. Take existing data

This is a very time consuming part of the project. 

We need to prepare the data:

- cleaning the data: prepare, clean, label, split
- get rid of garbage or empty datapoint

#### 2. Analyze it to identify patterns

Use a machine learning algorithm aka "Learning Algorithm" or "Learner". Choosing the algorithm is not automatic, the human is still involved in the process in the iterative process.

 #### 3. Then use the Results

The model.

#### 4. To make better Predictions about New Data

Think about it in terms of a high level of probablility.

Example: Zillow analysis of which real estate is being looked at for investment purposes rather than personal purchase. This might be useful to an investor. Is a property *hot* or *not*: may affect the competition for the property.

#### Learning Algorithm Categories:

##### Supervised Learning:

- Classification (single or multi-variate)
- Regression

##### Unsupervised Learning:

- Clustering
- Anomaly Detection

---

#### Getting Started:

- Azure machine learning studio
- Sagemaker
- Google cloud datalab
- Lobe.ai

When looking at algorithms, to start **DON'T try it understand how to implement every algorithm**, rather try to understand how the algorithm works at a high level and how to apply that knowledge.
