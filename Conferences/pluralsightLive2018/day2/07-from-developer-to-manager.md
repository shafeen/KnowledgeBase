# From Developer to Manager: Things You Should Know Before Making the Jump

What is it like?

Your Path:

Hands on/ Hands off

Stop Coding Now: 

- Stalls growth as a manager
- False sense of security and velocity
- Suck at both

Hands out of the code (at least at first)

---

Opening:

High growth or high turnover: try to stay in the same company.

Why do you want to be a manager: note that it is a different career.

---

Motivation:

Engineering manager -> Director of Engineering -> VP of Engineering -> CTO/CIO

Problems solving?

Engineering vs Product Manager.

Don't go into management for more money/title, it is not a promotion.

Reasons to choose management:

- Love for teaching 
- Help someone grow beyond their imagination
- Passion for the company
- Empathy

Continuing on....

Differences:

- Feedback: built-in, objective (dev) - Feedback: Rare, subjective (manager)
- Focus: Deliver value to customers (dev) - Focus: relationships (manager)
- Time: uninterrupted, focused (dev) - Time: interrupt driven (manager)

#### What do you do all day?

What does your calendar look like?

- Standup
- 1 on 1s:
  - Regular checkpoint (should happen at some regular cadence)
  - Direct report's meeting (they should set the agenda, not the manager)
  - Bi-directional feedback
  - Venting
  - Any question should be fair game (encourage psychological safety)
- Meetings:
  - should have a clear exit criteria
  - clear facilitator
  - user a timer to timebox 
  - law of two feet (if you are not contributing to this meeting, see if you can leave)
  - consider adding retrospective meetings about past projects (to learn from past projects)
- Staffing:
  - Make sure the team has the skills that we need.
- Process:
- Calendar Management
