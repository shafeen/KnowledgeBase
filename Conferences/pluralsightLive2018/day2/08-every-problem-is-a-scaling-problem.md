#### Patterns for effective leadership:

- Sell the change
- Implement the change
- Get feedback

#### 1. Leadership is a sales job

New ABCs of selling:

##### A - Attunement: 

- The capacity to take another's perspective, to understand their interests, and to see the world from their point of view.
- Exercise - pull up an (empty) chair.

##### B - Buoyancy:

- The capacity to stay afloat in an "ocean of rejection"
- Exercise - send yourself a rejection letter to give yourself the focus and energy to improve.

##### C - Clarity:

- The capacithy to help others see their problems in fresh and revealing ways, and to identify problems they didn't realize they had.
- Exercise - two irrational questions (V8 moved themselves from the drink isle to the produce isle, for example):
  - force the customer (or yourself) to justify why they didn't completely reject your product
  - why didn't they pick a lower number?

#### 2. To successfully implement a technology change, you must break the rules.

Your old rules may hold you back from fully benefitting from your technology change.

Ask and answer Goldratt's Four Questions:

1. What is the power of the technology
2.  
3.  
4.  

4 questions applied to the cloud:

- on demand access to compute, storage and application servcies
- diminishes the cost and rish of operating your own data center; increases speed to market
- annual cap-ex planning:; ticket based access to infrastructure; separate organizations for development and ops
- automated, secured self-service

#### 3. Leading without feedback is like sailing without a compass

Solicit more "real talk" from your team.

Don't be in the Ruinous Empathy quadrant.

Get feedback:

1. Have a go-to question:
   * Q: what can I do to make it easier for you to talk to/communicate with me?
2. Embrace the discomfort
3. Listen with the intent to understand, not to respond <——— VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT
4. Reward the candor to get more of it

#### 4. Rinse and Repeat!
