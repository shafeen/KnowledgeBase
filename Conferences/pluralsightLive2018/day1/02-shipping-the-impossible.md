Five Secrets to Getting Breakthrough Products to your customers. ( ***Caitlin Kalinowski*** )

Thoughts are things, be careful who you share them with. People will shoot them down if they seem too crazy.



#### Rule 1. Define your non-negotiables

(From Q/A: This seems to be the one that people disregard the most.)

Begin with the end in mind. Establish those clear priorities. What are the things that your product/company technology absolutely must do. Solve for user and customer experience. Think about your customers, and be disciplined enough to boil down your product to one or 2 key features.

---

#### Rule 2. You need Talent Fits and Misfits

When doing something new, sometimes you needs a very specific group of people and talent, and that group may turn out to be non-conventional. Think about diversity in your team composition, diversity can be great for design (and creative thinking).

---

#### Rule 3. Start with the Hardest Things First

Don't make difficult changes at the end of development. It's easier and less expensive to frontload the hardest things than changing large/hard things at the end and have it come back to bite them.

---

#### Rule 4. Pick One: Caution or Speed.

##### Caution: Check and recheck all assumptions

- medical products
- anything that poses a health of safety issue
- high volume products.

##### Speed: Choose your top priorities, and only focus on them.

- trying to beat a competitor to market.
- lower volume products

#### Rule 5. ALWAYS have a Back-Up Plan

You may not even want the MAIN team to even know that there is a backup plan. Having a secondary team to investigate all other possible options alongside the main team (possibly in the background) can save you a lot of time and effort and headache at the time.

---

#### Rule 6: Start with something that already exists



---

#### Rule 7: You can't go it alone

Have radical acceptance that you alone cannot do things by yourself. You need friends, collaborators, people, and how you treat them matters.

When building the impossible, think about who you want to be in the foxhole with and who you want to trust.



---

#### What Happens when it's ACTUALLY impossible?

Sometimes you might find that the world as it stands cannot support your product or idea. Be ready for when that happens.

Q: How do you motivate your team? Keep them aligned and hold on to them?

There no real way to hold on to them without caring for them and giving them missions to believe in and things to support.

Notes: The goal of the team should not be to define or understand the mission, your team members shouldn't have to "figure out" their mission, its the job of senior management to convince them of it. If you can't get behind a mission, then maybe you shouldn't be there as a team member.

Caitlin: I look for people that have intrinsic motivation, I don't believe in extrinsic motivation. I look for what people have done and motivated to do and continue to try to motivate them.

My questions and thoughts:

Q: What are your thoughts on the concept of pivoting?

Q: What happens when your non-negotiables collide with what your customers want?

Note: I don't necessarily agree with this.
