# Build a Better Hiring Process with Design Thinking

For many, hiring is:

- frustrating
- stressful
- not fun
- all of the above

Getting feedback from the (candidate) market, this can be a good thing. 

To get buy in to optimize the hiring process, talk about the time and (opportuniy) costs saved.

##### Goals for a her hiring process at her organization (and hopefully yours):

1. Cut the bias (improve diversity)

2. Improve the candidate experience (increase delight)

3. Get to yes (increase yield rate)

##### Methods:

User interviews, journey mapping and prototyping.

Conduct research -> map the Candidate Experience -> prototype solutions -> ship & iterate.

In an hour long onboarding sessions: we led interactive activities to introduce UX and conduct research. Bring talent on board to prototype solutions together, and ship improvements quickly.

My Questions:

Q: Question mentioning cutting bias: how do you know if the techniques implemented actually reduced bias?

Q: How do you gauge if the candidates interview experience has a positive correlation with the quality of the candidate? Or do you feel like that is a separate problem that needs to be solved?

A: They didn't seem to tackle that problem.

#### THIS TALK IS NOT VETTED AT ALL!!!!! NOT RECOMMENDED. She didn't seem to actually follow up with the technique or experiments. This talk seems to mostly be a set of suggestions.
