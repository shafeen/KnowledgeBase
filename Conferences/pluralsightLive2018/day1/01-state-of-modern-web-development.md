# The state of modern web development

Join us in this interactive discussion on the current state of Web development. We'll talk about frameworks, tools, processes, and best practices. Bring your questions and jump in to the conversation!

#### What is the modern web?

Accessibility, UI, UX, fast interactive experiences, meeting the user where they are.

Audience: DotNET, Angular, React, Vue, Polymer.

#### Q: How do you pick a language?

Don't choose an archaic, supported language. You should be able to find answers to your questions. You team composition should drive this to a large degree as well, you should try to leverage your team's strengths unless the thing you are trying to use is just too archaic and bad OR if the other language/technology you are choosing has significant benefits.

Analogy: Don't choose your car based on the tires.

#### Q: What is the state of the modern web with respect to page sizes on load?

Making Progressive Web Apps should be looked at possible. Respect your demographic and cater to those people: do they have good data access? do they have fast mobile devices? Think about reducing your application's download size.

#### Q: What frontend grid system should you use? (Bootstrap, Material, FlexBox, etc)

Majority of panel answers: bootstrap seems to dominate the answer. CSS doesn't excite most developers, so using a standard supported (and continuously updating) grid system like bootstrap is a good idea. You end up re-making bootstrap too many times. Don't build your own system own to re-solve already solved problems.

#### Q: What about GraphQL (over REST)?

Political answer: they both have a place in the world. 

One answer: (might have adoption issues) GraphQL seems to undo a lot of work done in HTTP, a lot of problems solved in http need to be reimplemented in graphQL. (This answer may have a lot of bias).

Another answer: I think graphql is going to get really big.

Pluralsight trends for GraphQL: people seem to be pushing for it, we will be teaching it.

#### Q: Where do you see gaps in today's frameworks?

We don't seem to see enough testing for deployed applications, more teams should try to inplement proper Continuous Integration and testing suites.

[ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/) --> investigate.

Keep in mind that the team and their productivity is VERY important, and you should try and cater to that.

#### Q: What is the current state of web development with respect to enterprise software?

Don't feel like you have to use the latest and greatest technology FOR THE HYPE ALONE, do what's right for your company or your product.

(Hampton) Pick something, go with it for as far as you can and then upgrade sensibly. Try to iterate as opportunity allows.

---

#### Q: Is modern web development a "young" person's game?

No. You can be a valuable contributor at every level. Although it's very likely that the top performers are simply putting in more time, that is simply the nature of the beast (software development in general). Choose good educational opportunities.
