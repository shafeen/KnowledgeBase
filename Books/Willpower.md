# Willpower 

by Baumeister and Tierney

#### Chapter 1: Is willpower more than just a metaphor?

You willpower is a finite resource over the course of your day, treat it as such. When you expend your willpower, you'll suffer from "ego depeletion", which is the term for describing people's diminished capacity to regulare their thoughts, feelings and actions. You use the same stock of willpower for all types of tasks.

The use of willpower can be put under 4 broad categories:

1. Control of thoughts - focus
2. Control of emotions - mood
3. Control of impulses - impulse control
4. Control over performance - perseverance

General guidance based on ego depletion studies: Focus on one project at a time.



#### Chapter 2: Where does the "power" in Willpower come from?

There is a link between glucose and self control. Exercising self control is associated with a drop in brain glucose levels. As the body uses glucose during self control, it starts to crave sweet things to eat, but low sugar, high protein foods and other nutritious foods fare just as well.

Controlling your glucose is a key step towards controlling your emotions, and willpower:

- **When you eat, go for the slow burn.** Go with foods with a low glycemic index: vegetables, nuts raw fruits, fish and other "good" fats.
- **When you're sick, save your glucose for your immune system.** Don't expect peak performance from yourself or others who are under the weather; the immune system is using so much of your glucose that there isn't enough left for the brain.
- **When you're tired, sleep.** Use your wilpower to set aside enough time to sleep. You'll behave better the next day, and sleep more easily the next night.



#### Chapter 3: A Brief History of the TODO list.

When setting goals, be aware of setting conflicting goals.

The 3 main consequences of conflicting goals:

1. You worry a lot: The more competing demands you face, the more time you spend comtemplating these demands.
2. You get less done: Avoid replacing action with rumination; people with clear unconflicting goals tend to forge ahead and make progress and don't waste time worrying that they got stuck.
3. Your mental and physical health suffers: The more goals conflicted, the more the people got stuck, and the more unhappy and unhealthy they became.

Humans suffer when their conflicting goals leave them sitting around doing nothing Decide which goals will do you the most good and pursue them.

**The Zeigarnik Effect:** Uncompleted tasks and unmet goals tend to pop into one's mind. Once the task is completed and the goal reached, however, the stream of reminders comes to a stop. If you have a goal without a *specific* plan to achieve it, the unconscious mind will nag the conscious mind to make a plan with specifics like time, place, and opportunity. Once a plan is formed, this nagging can stop.

**Avoid the monkey mind:** If you have a lot on your to-do list, the Zeignarik Effect could leave you leaping from task to task, and it won't be sedated by vague good intentions. If you've got a goal worth pursuing, figure out exactly what needs to be done next, and under what circumstances. Once you've formed a plan, specifying the very next action to be taken on the goal/project, you can relax knowing that for the moment, the monkey is still and your mind is calm (freeing up Willpower for other things).

Don't let unprocessed thoughts/items/stuff build up, process them down to **specific actionable items** before filing them away, so you are aware of what's there and feel sure that you know what to do next to make progress on those tasks. 



#### Chapter 4: Decision Fatigue.

Spending time making decisions depletes your supply of willpower. Because of this, **predeciding** can help.

- The less you care about the outcome of your decisions, the less depleting they are.
- The more you enjoy the topic of the decisions you making, the less depleting they are.

It takes willpower to make decisions, a depleted willpower state makes people look for ways to postpone or evade decisions (not doing anything vs choosing something to do amongst a pool of choices). This might be important to note when deciding on something to do from your to-do list in a depleted state.

Predeciding (if possible) on what actions to perform in a depleted state (morning, after work) might help you be more productive in the long run. Non-decisions will rob you of productivity in the long run.

Impulse control is very poor when decision fatigue sets in, avoid making important decisions at that time since marketers will exploit this fact to their benefit.



#### Chapter 5: Where have all the dollars gone?

Self monitoring invokes better self awareness and self control. 

Reflecting on what you plan to achieve but haven't yet accomplished can motivate you to reach your goals and then move on to more challenging new projects. Working this behavior into a habit might be a good starting point. Some people have gained additional benefits by comparing themselves with others: accomplishments, national averages, etc



#### Chapter 6: Can Willpower be strengthened?

> Getting your brain wired into little goals and achieving them, helps you achieve the bigger things you shouldn't be able to do.
>
> David Blaine

Concentrating effort on changing a habitual behavior can lead to improved willpower **stamina**. Examples include correcting posture, using the non-dominant hand for certain habitual tasks, etc.

Focusing on one specific form of self control could yield much larger benefits in areas of your life that have nothing to do with the specific exercises you perform. Your willpower will get stronger. Examples include fitness, study discipline, money management, waking up early every day, etc.

*Maintaining* strong willpower on the other hand, requires motivation.



#### Chapter 7: Outsmarting yourself in the heart of darkness.

A great strategy is to not rely on willpower in all situations but to conserve it for those moments when it's indispensable. Precommitment can be a good strategy to conserve willpower. If you give yourself an incentive to temporarily restrain a negative habit, or foster/follow through with a positive one, it could turn into something permanent and more valuable: *a habit*.

 Self control turns out to be most effective when people use it to establish good habits and break bad ones. Spending a bit of willpower to perform or set up orderly habits can actually improve self-control in the long run by triggering automatic mental processes that don't require much energy. 

Experiments indicate that a narrow, concrete, here-and-now (*low-level*) focus works against self-control, whereas a broad, abstract, long-term (*high-level*) focus supports it. High level thinking encourages people to pass up a quick reward for something better in the future.



#### Chapter 8: Did a higher power help Eric Clapton and Mary Karr?

A personal goal can seem more real once you speak it aloud, particularly if you *know* the audience will be monitoring you. Regular monitoring and the chance to compare yourself with peers can boost progress towards goals.

**Hyperbolic discounting**: As we approach short-term temptation, our tendency to discount the future follow the steep curve of a hyperbola, a tendency known as hyperbolic discounting.****

**Bright Lines:** try to set clear, simple, unambiguous rules. Avoid "fuzzy boundaries". While not practical for *all* self control problems, it can work well in many situations.



#### Chapter 9: Raising strong children.

> Forget about self-esteem, focus on self-control

Watch your child's behavior and impose appropriate rewards or punishments. There are 3 basic facets of punishment: severity, speed and consistency. Severity is the least important of the 3, with speed and consistency being more important. A stern word or two is often enough as long as it's done carefully and regularly.

When parents are inconsistent, they might let an infraction slide and then try to compensate with an extra strict punishment for the next one. This requires less self-control on the parents' part but will end up being harmful from the child's point of view, you don't want them to think that the punishments are unfair and learn that the most important thing is not how you behave, but whether or not you get caught.

When telling you child to do something, you need to discipline to go in there with them and model exactly what to do. Establish a system of rewards and punishments in advance, and if you're giving either one to a child, explain *exactly* why. As they  get older, it becomes more useful to ask them what goals they have for themselves, then help them get there with the right incentives.

To recap the basic steps of self-control:

- setting clear and attainable goals
- giving/getting instantaneous feedback
- and offering enough encouragement for people to keep practicing and improving.



#### Chapter 10: The perfect storm of dieting.

> Diets typically work at first, by fail miserably in the long run

**What-the-hell effect**: Dieters have a fixed target in mind for their max daily calories, and when they exceed it for some unexpected reason, they regard their diet as blown for the day. That day is classified as a failure, regardless of what happens, So they think, *What the hell, I might as well enjoy myself today*, and the resulting binge puts on far more weight than the original lapse.

**The nutritional catch-22**:

1. In order to not eat, you need willpower.
2. In order to have willpower, a dieter needs to eat.

**Defensive strategies**: If yearnings seem overpowering, we can suggest the following strategies:

- Tell yourself that you can have a small sweet dessert later if you still want it.
- Meanwhile, eat something else (healthy).

Remember, the depleted state makes you feel everything more intensely. Instead of squandering your willpower on a strict diet and resisting temptations, avoid temptations, eat enough glucose to conserve willpower, and use your self-control for more promising long-term strategies.

**Precommitment based self-control strategies**:

- keep fattening food out of reach and out of sight, this conserves willpower
- brush your teeth early in the evening as a precommitment
- consider *implementation intention*: instead of making general plans to reduce calories, make highly specific plans for automatic behaviors in certain situations, like *if* *x happens, I'll do y*; the more automatic you make this behavior, the more willpower you will conserve

For weight control, the more carefully and frequently you monitor yourself, the better you'll control yourself. Even simple forms of monitoring, like *keeping a food diary*, can make a big difference.

**Positive procrastination**: Never say never when it comes to food. Results suggest that telling yourself "I can have this later" operates in the mind a bit like having it now. It satisfies the craving to some degree, and can be even more effective at suppressing the appetite than actually eating the treat you want.
