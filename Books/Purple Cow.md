Purple Cow (by Seth Godin)

#### Getting In
_No one is going to eagerly adapt to your product_. Most consumers are happy and 
sold on what they've got. They're not looking for a replacement, and they don't
like adapting to anything new. You don't have the power to force them to. The
only change you have is to sell to those who like change, who like new stuff, 
who are actively looking for what it is you sell.
  
You must design a product remarkable enough to attract the early adopters--but
flexible enough and attractive enough that those adopters will have an easy time
spreading the idea to the rest of the curve.

#### Ideas That Spread, Win
Don't try to make a product for everybody, because that is a product for nobody.
The way you break through to the mainstream is to target a niche instead of a 
huge market. With a niche, you can segment a chunk of the mainstream, and create
an ideavirus so focused that it overwhelms that small slice of the market that 
really and truly will respond to what you sell.


#### The Big Misunderstanding
Marketing in a post-TV world is no longer about making a product better _after_
it's designed and built--it's about designing the thing to be virus-worthy in
the first place. Products engineered to cross the chasm--with built-in protection
for wary consumers--are way more likely to succeed than products not engineered
that way.

#### Who's Listening?
IT IS USELESS TO ADVERTISE TO ANYONE (EXCEPT INTERESTED SNEEZERS WITH INFLUENCE).

#### Not All Customers Are the Same
Differentiate your customers. Find the group that's most profitable. Find the 
group that's most likely to sneeze. Figure out how to develop/advertise/reward
either group. Ignore the rest. Your ads shouldn't cater to the masses. Your ads
(and products) shoudn't cater to the masses, they should cater to the customers
you'd choose if you could choose your customers.

#### The Problem with the Cow
In a crowded marketplace, fitting in is failing. In a busy marketplace, not
standing out is the same as being invisible.

Here is the catch-22 of the Purple Cow. If times are tough, your peers and your
boss may very well say that you can't afford to be remarkable. After all, we have
to conserve, to play it safe; we don't have the money to make a mistake. In good
time, however, *those same people* will tell you to relax, take it easy; we can
afford to be conservative, to play it safe.

The good news is that the prevailing wisdom makes your job even easier. Since 
just about everyone is petrified of the Cow, you can be remarkable with even less
effort. If successful new products are the ones that stand out, and most people 
desire not to stand out, you're set!

Boring is always the most risky strategy.

#### Projections, Profits, and the Purple Cow

Mas marketing demands mass products. And mass products beg for mass marketing.
This equation leads to dangerous catch-22, one with two parts.

**Part One: Boring Products.** Companies built around mass marketing develop their
products accordingly. These companies round the edges, smooth out the differentiating
features, and try to make products that are bland enough to work for the masses.
The way a product or idea reaches the bulk of the market is to move from the left 
to the right. You can no longer reach everyone at once. And if you don't grab the
attention of and enthusiasm of the sneezers, your product withers.

**Part Two: Scary Budgets.** In order to launch a product for the masses, you need
to spend big. The problem with a scary budget is that you HAVE to make the ads
work, and quickly. This front-loading of the budget does two things to your product
 * It means you get very few chances to launch new products because each one is
   so expensive.
 * It doesn't give you a chance to ride through the idea diffusion curve. It takes
   a while to reach the sneezers, who take a while to reach the rest of the population.
   But your front-loaded budget means that by the time the majority have heard 
   of you, you're already burned out or bankrupt.
   
#### Mass Marketers Hate to Measure
Direct marketers realize that measurement is the key to success. Figure out what
works, and do more of it!

What could you measure? What would that cost? How fast can you get the results?
If you can afford it, try it. "If you measure it, it will improve."
