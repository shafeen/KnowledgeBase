Purple Cow (by Seth Godin)

#### Getting In
_No one is going to eagerly adapt to your product_. Most consumers are happy and 
sold on what they've got. They're not looking for a replacement, and they don't
like adapting to anything new. You don't have the power to force them to. The
only change you have is to sell to those who like change, who like new stuff, 
who are actively looking for what it is you sell.
  
You must design a product remarkable enough to attract the early adopters--but
flexible enough and attractive enough that those adopters will have an easy time
spreading the idea to the rest of the curve.

#### Ideas That Spread, Win
Don't try to make a product for everybody, because that is a product for nobody.
The way you break through to the mainstream is to target a niche instead of a 
huge market. With a niche, you can segment a chunk of the mainstream, and create
an ideavirus so focused that it overwhelms that small slice of the market that 
really and truly will respond to what you sell.


#### The Big Misunderstanding
Marketing in a post-TV world is no longer about making a product better _after_
it's designed and built--it's about designing the thing to be virus-worthy in
the first place. Products engineered to cross the chasm--with built-in protection
for wary consumers--are way more likely to succeed than products not engineered
that way.
